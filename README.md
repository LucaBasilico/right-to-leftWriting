We will see a navbar with an Arabian style.

If you want to translate a text into Arabian style, you have to use two options.

The first is an html addiction with a **dir="rtl"** tag.
In HTML5, the dir attribute can be used on any HTML element.

The second id a css addiction with a **orientation** tag. You have to add this script:
 direction: rtl
*Example:*
body{
  direction: rtl;
}
